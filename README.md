## Overview
This is a command line hangman game written in only using "simple" python. 
A use of basic python functionality to create something fun and educational, I have not used and external libraries as this is a good way for beginners to better understand core python concepts.

## Requirements
For this you need  to have python 3.7 installed aaaand... that's it!

You can check this with:
```bash
$ python3 --version
```
or on windows:
```dos
> py3 --version
```
If you don't get a version number install python 3 to continue.

## Upcoming Feature
Ideas for additional features: 
  - When quitting part way through a word it's saved and then loaded when re-entering the game.
  
The above features will be implemented and can be removed and changed as required from the HangmanPy.py file located in HangmanPy/HangmanPy/HangmanPy.py

## Installing
Download and unzip files, 
or use the git clone command as follows:
```
git clone <URL>
```
where <URL> is the  URL of the main package page (likely the one you're reading this on).
  
## Running
Run using python3 with the folowing command (in unix) while in the directory HangmanPy:

```bash
$ python3 HangmanPy.py
```
or on windows:
```dos
> py3 HangmanPy.py
```
